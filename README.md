# js-password-generator


## Description
 
 This project is a web application that allows users with access to sensitive data to generate random passwords based on criteria they select. The motivation behind this project is to create a tool that enables users to create strong passwords that provide greater security for sensitive data.

 This project solves the problem of weak passwords that are easily guessed or hacked, which can lead to security breaches and compromised data. During the development of this project, I learned how to create a responsive user interface, use JavaScript to generate random passwords, and validate user input.
